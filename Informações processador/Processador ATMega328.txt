AVR CPU Core - General Purpose Register File

	The fast-access Register File contains 32 x 8-bit general purpose working registers with a single clock cycle access time. This allows single-cycle Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) operation. In a typical ALU operation, two operands are output from the Register File, the operation is executed, and the result is stored back in the Register File – in one clock cycle. Six of the 32 registers can be used as three 16-bit indirect address register pointers for Data Space addressing – enabling efficient address calculations. One of the these address pointers can also be used as an address pointer for look up tables in Flash program memory. These added function registers are the 16-bit X-, Y-, and Z-register.

	The Register File is optimized for the AVR Enhanced RISC instruction set. In order to achieve the required performance and flexibility, the following input/output schemes are supported by the Register File:
	- One 8-bit output operand and one 8-bit result input
	- Two 8-bit output operands and one 8-bit result input
	- Two 8-bit output operands and one 16-bit result input
	- One 16-bit output operand and one 16-bit result input

	The X-register, Y-register, and Z-register:
		The registers R26...R31 have some added functions to their general purpose usage. These registers are 16-bit address pointers for indirect addressing of the data space.
		In the different addressing modes these address registers have functions as fixed displacement, automatic increment, and automatic decrement (see the instruction set reference for details).

	Instruções de acesso à memória (modo de endereçamento indireto): 
		
		
The AVR core combines a rich instruction set with 32 general purpose working registers. All the 32 registers are
directly connected to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), allowing two independent registers to be accessed in one
single instruction executed in one clock cycle.

In a single clock cycle an ALU operation using
two register operands is executed, and the result is stored back to the destination register.

- In-System Reprogrammable Flash Program Memory

The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P Program Counter (PC) is 11/12/13/14 bits wide, thus addressing the
2/4/8/16K program memory locations. 
Since all AVR instructions are 16 or 32 bits wide, the Flash is organized as 2/4/8/16K x 16

=> Tem 16K localizações da memória. Cada localização tem 17 bits, então nossa memória tem (16348*17) = 278528 bits = 34816 bytes

- EEPROM Data Memory

The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P contains 256/512/512/1Kbytes of data EEPROM memory.
